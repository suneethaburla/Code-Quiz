# Code-Quiz

## Project Title: Code-Quiz
## Project Description
This project describes how to create a timer-based quiz application with multiple-choice questions that stores high scores on the client-side. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript and Jquery code.

## Play proceeds as follows:

* The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz" and the quiz instructions.

* Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with 60 seconds and immediately begins countdown.

* Incorrect answers will penalise the time by 5 seconds. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. 

* When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with the final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in localStorage.
